### Hi there âš¡

Does the rabbit hole ever end?

These days I'm mostly interested in **Bitcoin**, the **Lightning Network** and self-hosted apps, but I worked on many other random things in the past.

Read about my programming story [here](https://ibz.me/programming/).

My professional work history is on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/story/ibz).

Below is a summary of my **personal projects**, hosted here on GitHub.

What I am working on at the moment:

* [Lightning Shell](https://github.com/ibz/lightning-shell) - The shell for your personal server
   * status: Released on [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel) and [Citadel](https://github.com/runcitadel)
* [usocial](https://github.com/ibz/usocial) - The minimalist feed reader, feed aggregator and podcast client
   * status: Released on [Citadel](https://github.com/runcitadel)
* [stasi](https://github.com/ibz/stasi) / [gan](https://github.com/ibz/gan) / [gan-gen](https://github.com/ibz/gan-gen) - Simple home monitoring system for Raspberry Pi
   * status: Works for me, but more of a hack still

Past projects:

* [Kanji Explorer](https://github.com/ibz/kanjiexplorer.com) (2012) - Navigate kanji (Japanese characters) using radicals
   * status: Still online, still works.
* [traveli.st](https://github.com/ibz/travelist) (2008 - 2009) - A social network for travelers
   * status: Technically it worked, but never got any traction
* [nuages](https://github.com/ibz/nuages) (2008 - 2009) / [tzadik](https://github.com/ibz/tzadik) (2009) / [feather](https://github.com/ibz/feather) (2012) - Multiple attempts to write my own photoblog engine
   * status: They worked fine, but I don't photoblog anymore.
* [LHelper](https://github.com/ibz/LHelper) (2000, I was 15 years old) - A program that inflects Latin nouns. The code is quite embarrassing, but I keep it around as a memory.
